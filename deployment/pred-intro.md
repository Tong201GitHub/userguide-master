# Turi Predictive Services
 Turi Predictive Services enable straightforward deployment of machine learning models as reliable and scalable web services for easy integration into predictive applications using a low-latency REST API. With one command, launch a cluster, deploy a model, update a model (with no downtime), or capture interaction data to improve the next version of the model.

 As of Predictive Services version 2.0 we have separated its documentation into the standalone [Turi Predictive Services User Guide](https://turi.com/products/predictive-services/docs/index.html). Please continue to read there and update your bookmarks accordingly.

You can find the previous Predictive Services user guide [here](https://turi.com/learn/userguide/v1.10/deployment/pred-intro.html).
